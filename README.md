# Green Keepers Landscaping
Green Keepers Landscaping is a website that was designed for a landscaping company in Saint George, Utah. It was developed for the owner, so they could have an online site where customers could see the area they served, some of their previous work and have a clear way to easily contact them through email. The website never went live because at the time of creation, Fall 2019, the hosting domain that was picked didn't allow custom CSS for webpages they hosted, all design had to come from their templating and this was an unforseen issue with deploying this version.
